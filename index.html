This experience solidifed her desire to work in the communications field and made her even more passionate about and excited for her studies. </p></div>

She was also able to interact with other interns that summer and enjoyed getting to know other driven, young individuals. </p></div>

                    <p>For my videography class this semester, we were tasked with creating a video montage that reflected a significant aspect of what JMU means to us. The goal of the video was to clearly convey the essence of the aspect I chose and evoke the intended feeling. I chose to create a video that showed my feelings of lonliness and longing to spend time with my boyfriend back at home.</p>

                    <p>Another assignment from my videography class was to create a public service announcement (PSA). The PSA could focus on a issue or need within JMU, the local community or the world. I chose to focus mine on how much we miss out on each day because we have a screen in front of our face or we are on our phone, hoping to encourage people to not miss out on the little things.</p>

                    <p>Our final project in my videography class was to conduct an interview and get b-roll footage  highlighting a community person, organization, place or activity. I chose to film a video about Loudoun School for Advanced Studies (LSAS), the private school that my mom teaches at. I was able to interview her, along with another teacher and get some additional footage while there.</p>

                    <p>Each spring break, I have traveled to Cape Canaveral, Florida to visit my grandparents and have brought a friend or two along each time. Capturing the memories on these trips have been super fun for me and also a great way to be able to look back on our adventures and great week. Stay tuned for this year's montage!</p>
